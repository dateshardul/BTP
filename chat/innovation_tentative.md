## 7. Semantic Compression and Prioritization

### Research Foundation

Recent advances in semantic compression demonstrate that Large Language Models can achieve significant compression ratios while preserving semantic meaning, with some approaches showing compression gains up to 24x for knowledge graph embeddings while maintaining 99.5% accuracy[39]. Research in semantic compression for 3D objects shows that extreme compression rates can be achieved by operating directly on core concepts rather than structural information[40].

Nokia's cXR+ semantic compression research demonstrates practical implementation for networked immersive environments, using color codes to reduce transmitted data volume while maintaining reconstruction accuracy[41].
