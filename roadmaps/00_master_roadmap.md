## 📊 Success Metrics

### **Technical Targets**
- **Latency**: <100ms for spatial synchronization
- **Accuracy**: cm-level spatial precision
- **Scalability**: 20+ simultaneous users
- **Frame Rate**: 60+ FPS on target devices
- **Compression**: 24x reduction for annotation data
- **Uptime**: 80%+ in challenging field conditions
- **Continuous Operation**: 1hr+ without major issues

### **Deployment Targets**
- **User Satisfaction**: 90%+ after 3 months
- **Security Performance**: Zero incidents in first year
- **Training Effectiveness**: 30%+ improvement vs traditional methods

## 🚨 Cross-Component Risks

### **High-Risk Integration Points**
1. **Client-Server Spatial Sync** → Implement robust testing framework early
2. **Multi-device Authentication** → Standardize security protocols across teams
3. **Data Stream Performance** → Regular load testing between client and data layers
4. **Network Resilience** → Build offline capabilities into all components

### **Timeline Dependencies**
- **Week 6**: All teams must have basic authentication working
- **Week 10**: Client-server spatial sync must be functional
- **Week 16**: Data streaming infrastructure must support full load
- **Week 22**: All components must integrate for end-to-end testing

## 📅 Key Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Components Involved |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 4 | Foundation Complete | All components have basic architecture |
| 10 | Multi-user Sync Working | Client + Server + Data integration |
| 16 | Core Features Complete | Full client-server-data pipeline |
| 22 | Advanced Features Ready | All components feature-complete |
| 28 | System Integration Complete | End-to-end testing successful |
| 32 | Production Deployment | Real-world validation complete |

## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

### **Shared Infrastructure**
- **Version Control**: Git with component-specific branches
- **CI/CD**: Docker containers for each component
- **Communication**: gRPC for inter-service communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for all components
- **Security**: Shared JWT/certificate infrastructure

### **Team Coordination**
- **Daily Standups**: Component-specific teams
- **Weekly Integration**: Cross-team dependency reviews
- **Bi-weekly Demos**: End-to-end system demonstrations
- **Monthly Reviews**: Architecture and roadmap adjustments
